# IntelliMatch: Job Applicant Assessment Tool

This toy project is a simple web application designed to match job descriptions with candidate resumes using OpenAI's API. It was a toy project for me to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
- **PDF Upload**: Allows uploading job descriptions and resumes as PDFs.
- **OpenAI Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's API to evaluate the fit between job descriptions and resumes.

## Quick Start
1. **Obtain an OpenAI API Key**: Essential for analysis.
2. **Local Storage of API Key**: The application prompts for an OpenAI API key on the first load, storing it in browser storage. *Note: Storing API keys in browser storage is not secure and is used here for learning purposes only.*
3. **Open `index.html`**: Run the application by opening the `index.html` file in a browser.

## Usage
Upload the job description and candidate's resume PDFs, then click "Analyze Fit" for the assessment.
